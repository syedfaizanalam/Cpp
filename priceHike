/*Write a program that calculates a rate 
increase for a gym membership. Consider the 
following scenario:

A gym membership, which currently charges 
$600 per year for membership, has announced 
that it will increase its membership fee by 
2 percent each year for the next three years.

Write a program that uses a loop to display 
the projected rates for the next three years. 
Be sure to include comments throughout your 
code where appropriate.
